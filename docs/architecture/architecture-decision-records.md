# CyberTask Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Microservices Architecture Pattern

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team, Engineering Leads

### Context
CyberTask requires a scalable, maintainable architecture that can support rapid feature development, independent team work, and high availability requirements. We need to choose between monolithic and microservices architecture patterns.

### Decision
We will adopt a microservices architecture pattern with domain-driven design principles.

### Rationale

#### Advantages
- **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can work independently on different services
- **Technology Diversity**: Each service can use the most appropriate technology stack
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled based on demand
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't bring down the entire system
- **Deployment Independence**: Services can be deployed separately with zero-downtime

#### Trade-offs
- **Operational Complexity**: More services to monitor, deploy, and maintain
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication introduces latency
- **Data Consistency**: Managing distributed transactions and eventual consistency
- **Testing Complexity**: Integration testing across services is more complex

### Implementation
- Start with 6 core services: User, Task, Project, Notification, Analytics, AI
- Use API Gateway pattern for external communication
- Implement service discovery and load balancing
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling

### Consequences
- Need robust DevOps practices and infrastructure
- Requires distributed tracing and monitoring
- Team organization around service boundaries
- Investment in API design and versioning strategies

## ADR-002: Database-per-Service Pattern

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team, Database Team

### Context
In our microservices architecture, we need to decide on data management strategy. Options include shared database or database-per-service pattern.

### Decision
Each microservice will own its data and have a dedicated database instance, following the database-per-service pattern.

### Rationale

#### Advantages
- **Service Autonomy**: Services can evolve their data models independently
- **Technology Fit**: Each service can use the most appropriate database technology
- **Fault Isolation**: Database issues affect only one service
- **Scalability**: Database can be optimized and scaled per service needs

#### Challenges
- **Data Consistency**: Cross-service data consistency requires careful design
- **Query Complexity**: Cross-service queries need to be handled at application level
- **Operational Overhead**: More database instances to manage

### Implementation
- PostgreSQL for most services (User, Task, Project, Notification)
- Redis for caching and session management
- Elasticsearch for Analytics service full-text search
- ClickHouse for Analytics service time-series data
- Event sourcing for critical audit trails

### Consequences
- Implement saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Use eventual consistency where appropriate
- API composition for cross-service data queries
- Robust backup and monitoring for multiple databases

## ADR-003: Event-Driven Architecture with Apache Kafka

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team, Platform Team

### Context
Microservices need to communicate and stay synchronized. We need to choose between synchronous (REST APIs) and asynchronous (message-driven) communication patterns.

### Decision
Implement event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka for asynchronous communication between services.

### Rationale

#### Advantages
- **Loose Coupling**: Services don't need to know about each other directly
- **Scalability**: Asynchronous processing improves system throughput
- **Resilience**: Messages are persisted and can be replayed
- **Audit Trail**: Event log provides natural audit trail
- **Real-time Updates**: Enables real-time features and notifications

#### Trade-offs
- **Complexity**: Event-driven systems are harder to debug and test
- **Eventual Consistency**: Data may be temporarily inconsistent
- **Message Ordering**: Need to handle out-of-order messages
- **Infrastructure Overhead**: Kafka cluster requires management

### Implementation
- Kafka cluster with 3+ brokers for high availability
- Event schemas with versioning (Avro/JSON Schema)
- Dead letter queues for failed message processing
- Kafka Connect for external system integration
- CQRS pattern where appropriate

### Consequences
- All services must handle eventual consistency
- Implement idempotent message processing
- Comprehensive monitoring of message flows
- Event versioning strategy for backward compatibility

## ADR-004: JWT-based Authentication with OAuth 2.0

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-30  
**Deciders**: Security Team, Backend Team

### Context
CyberTask needs secure, scalable authentication that supports web, mobile, and API access. We need to choose between session-based and token-based authentication.

### Decision
Implement JWT-based authentication with OAuth 2.0 for third-party integrations and multi-factor authentication support.

### Rationale

#### Advantages
- **Stateless**: No server-side session storage required
- **Scalability**: Tokens can be verified without database calls
- **Cross-Domain**: Works across different domains and services
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Tokens work well with mobile applications
- **Third-party Integration**: OAuth 2.0 supports external providers

#### Trade-offs
- **Token Size**: JWTs are larger than session IDs
- **Revocation**: Cannot easily revoke individual tokens
- **Security**: Tokens contain data and must be protected
- **Refresh Logic**: Need refresh token mechanism

### Implementation
- RS256 algorithm for signing tokens
- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Long-lived refresh tokens (30 days)
- Token blacklisting for logout/revocation
- MFA integration with TOTP and SMS

### Consequences
- Implement secure token storage in clients
- Token refresh logic in all client applications
- Comprehensive logging of authentication events
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
